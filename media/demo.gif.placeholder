# Demo GIF Placeholder

This is a placeholder file for the demo.gif animation.

To create the actual demo.gif:
1. Use a screen recording tool (e.g., ScreenToGif, LICEcap, or OBS Studio)
2. Record the following features:
   - Opening Kimi IDE panel
   - Starting a new chat
   - Asking a coding question
   - Receiving AI response with code
   - Using code actions (copy, insert, create file)
   - Using @ commands for context
3. Recommended size: 800x600 or 1200x800
4. Keep under 5MB for faster loading

Replace this file with the actual demo.gif when ready.
